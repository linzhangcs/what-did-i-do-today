description: Retro for behavioral interview with the hiring manager
---
I did a behavioral interview with the hiring manager today. Overall a good interview. The biggest issue - blue tooth headphone! Turn off my cellphone during an interview! There were so many calls during the interview. Man, I can't believe that was the biggest issue. 

> Turn off cellphone
>
> Turn on Do Not Disturb

**questions:**

> What's the most diffcult project?
>
> What's your company's code review process? 
>
> How do you deal with a coworker that is diffcult?
>
> How do you manage when there are multiple things to do? - follow up **what do you when there are multiple equally important things to do?**
>
> **What do you do when your boss is unavailable?** 

##### well done:

\- Write out answers to some of the most asked questions

\- Did a mock interview to practice - got some feedback

\- Some of the answers were engaging - because they were stories, to the point, and explained the situation, actions, and outcomes. 

##### areas of improvement:

\- Technical issues - I need to prepare to deal with that before the interview

\- Speak slower and more clearly

\- Prepare by writing out the story structure of my past experiences - for the STAR format is pretty good. It seems like that is what every company is using - situation, tasks, action, result

**my Impression of the company:**

\- Great onboarding process - basecamp 3 days, an overview of current services, daily standup, talk with four team leads to better understand the department vision, buddy that will help you for the first week to set up, one-on-one with the team lead every week. 

\- Manager's management philosophy - transparency & value-driven decision making - I should have pushed for examples.  

\- Diverse culture

**\- Concepts to look into, micro-services front-end architecture / scalable frontend** 

\- Learned about accessibility in gaming. That is so interesting, also what a great way to explain the challenges for blind and sightless players.
