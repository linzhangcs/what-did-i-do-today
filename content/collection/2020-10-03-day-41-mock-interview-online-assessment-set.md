description: Did an online assessment interview set on leetcode - medium question was harder
---
Tried out a new category of mock interview sets. The medium question was hard for me - it was a graph problem, but was fun to solve. I didn't know how to detect a cycle in the graph. I will need to learn more about graph theory and Dijkstra's algorithm. This Network Delay Time question a good place to start on the topic! However, it is unlikely to show up in the front-end dev interviews. I will focus on understanding other concepts firest.
