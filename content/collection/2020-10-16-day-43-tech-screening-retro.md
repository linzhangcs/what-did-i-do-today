Question one:

> Array summation: 
>
> time: 20 minutes
>
> time-complexity: O(n^2)

I used a brute force solution, a double nested loop to go through all of the number pairs and check if the sum is in the test array. 

What's the optimal solution for this? Or at least **a more performant solution than this?**

Question two: 

> Currency recognition
>
> time: 1 hour 40 minutes

The challenge of this questions is handling all of the cases to validate the currency string.

This is type of question showed up again. I think learning regex will be very helpful. It took me too long for this question, because I had to google how to use regex to do this. I don't know the expession syntax works. Also, I am not sure about how str.slice(), and I didn't know string and array both have includes(). 

Overall, I have the same issues: 

\- speed

\- ideas for different solutions

\- test along the way

Consistant practice can improve all those issues. At my current level, I need to focus on my implementation speed. Practice enough JS language basics - commonly used functions for string and arrays, data structure. 

Speed run for problem solving - I noticed I go back and forth with my ideas, like variable names, what to do next, what function to use, etc. Small things add up to wasted time in interviews. I think this question really showcased my problem. I got to be more confident - that only comes with enough small wins and successful outcomes.
