description: Tested out Mock feature on Leetcode

Found out here is a new Mock feature on Leetcode. It's pretty good for interviewing. The medium question of this set was confusing. The input format was hard to understand but the question was pretty straightforward. It was a test of writing methods for a JS class.

 I also did two questions for preparing for the upcoming interview with Karat.
