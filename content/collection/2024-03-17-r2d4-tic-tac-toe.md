I s﻿tarted working on the react.dev documentation tutorial two days ago and a working version. I think the react part was clearly explained. It was nice to have a clear walk-through like that. I think that's the clarity I want to provide to be qualified as fully understanding something. Also, I like it made some modifications so it's easier to understand. I will implement this game again with an improved version of the calculateOwner function and the grid rendering. 

I﻿t's fun to learn and understand more :)
