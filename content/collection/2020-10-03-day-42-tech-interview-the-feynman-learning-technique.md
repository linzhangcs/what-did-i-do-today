### Retrospectives

Today I did a technical interviewing with karat - it's an interview platform. Their service is doing technical interviewing for companies. 

##### well done:

\- focused on the questions and the interviewer

\- stayed calm during the interview

\- explained to the interviewer when I need the documentation

\- used Map() with ease - improved

\- wrote out comments before coding

\- asked for help when need to talk it out loud

\- asked for feedback

##### areas of improvement:

\- prepare a short summary of my past experience - a 1 to 2 mins explanation

\- prepare a short summary of one of my past projects - think about the key factors to talk about: type, team, scope, problem, task, action, result, and etc.

\- prepare an explanation of the biggest technical challenge - problem, task, action, and result

\- practice my response - maybe record myself

\- solve more problems with timer - need to keep track of my time and learn to perform under time pressure. 

\- plan to do a mock set every other day and track individual problem time

\- use the Feynman technique for learning and testing if I know a concept - not just knowing the name but what it means.
