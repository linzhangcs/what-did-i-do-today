For a long time, I was focused on the wrong things regarding programming. I looked for quick solutions to my immediate problems but did not stop to think about why and what I was doing. So enough of this, it's definitely not working. Let me go back to the basics, learn all of the fundamentals along with other stuff. 

For today, I covered Javascript Fundamentals section 1 - 10  and Objects: the basics section 1! Interesting facts I didn't know before: 

* \*\* exponentiation operator - I use Math.pow() in the past
* *let c = 3 - (a = b + 1); 👀 // c = 3 - b + 1,  a = b+1*
* *String comparison: JS uses unicode order, so 'a' > 'A'. 'a' has greater index in the internal encoding table.*
* *let a = 0; let b = "0"; Boolean(a) // false,  Boolean(b) // true, a == b //true 😅*
* *null > 0 // false, null == 0 //false, null >= 0 // true  😅😅😅*
* *The in Operator - for testing existance of properties in objects. - "name" in object - true / false*
* *\[] notation is more powerful than dot notation - \[] notation can use property name as a result of an expression vs a literal string 🐛*
