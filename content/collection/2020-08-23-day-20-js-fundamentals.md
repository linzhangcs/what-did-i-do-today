Going over the basics! I got to learn and review all of the fundamentals along with other stuff. 

![js fundamental sections covered today](/uploads/screen-shot-2020-08-23-at-12.55.43-am.png "js fundamental sections covered today")

For today, I covered Javascript Fundamentals section 1 - 10  and Objects: the basics section 1! Interesting facts I didn't know before: 

* **\*\* exponentiation operator** - I use Math.pow() in the past
* *let c = 3 - (a = b + 1); 👀 // c = 3 - b + 1,  a = b+1*
* *String comparison: **JS uses unicode order, so 'a' > 'A**'. 'a' has greater index in the internal encoding table.*
* *let a = 0; let b = "0"; Boolean(a) // false,  Boolean(b) // true, a == b //true 😅*
* *null > 0 // false, null == 0 //false, null >= 0 // true  😅😅😅*
* ***The in Operator** - for testing existance of properties in objects. - "name" in object - true / false*
* ***\[] notation is more powerful than dot notation** - \[] notation can use property name as a result of expression vs a literal string in dot notation🐛*
