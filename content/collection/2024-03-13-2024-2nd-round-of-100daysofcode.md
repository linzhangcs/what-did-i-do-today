M﻿y last round of #100daysofcode was in 2020. That was four years ago, it was a good experience, but I stopped after 80 days. Starting a new job was pretty demanding and could not cope with more coding after a whole day of looking at a screen.  

I have a better outlook on work now, a much more healthy one! I want to continue coding practice and add more activities. Instead of only doing online tutorials, I will use more structured and interactive ways of learning. Books, projects, and online pair programming. This will make this round more fun and varied! 

A﻿lso I have some specific goals and tech I want to explore and achieve:

* design and build my personal design system
* make a new version of my portolio
* d﻿esign and build an full-stack app
* p﻿air programming - practice good technical communication - 2 sessions per weeks
* p﻿ractice project management for my personal projects  - kanban / scrumn
* o﻿ptional - contribute to an open source project

T﻿hat's definitely enough work for 100 days!  GO 2﻿024, excited to get better at coding :)
